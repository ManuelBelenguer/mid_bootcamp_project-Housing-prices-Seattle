Introducction

This is part of the mid-bootcamp project for IronHack (Oct.2020-Dic.2020) done in groups of three. In this repository
you'll find the approach followed by myself. If you'd like to have an idea of how the project was performed as a group
you can follow this link (LINK HERE). 


Objectives

The following project will create a model in order to predict the house prices for the city of Seattle for the period
may-2014/may-2015 as accurately as possible. This project will use a database from Kaggle (LINK HERE) to which we'll perform
the necessary data cleaning/wrangling, explanatory data analysis (EDA), follow by the creation of the model and an
error matrix that will evaluate the performance of the model.

	-Note: a best result will be getting a R2 above 90%.

	- id: Identificator for each different property.

	- yr_built: Year the house was built.
	- yr_renovated: Year the house was renovated; if it's never been renovated will yr_renovated = 0.
	- zipcode: zipcode that the house is in.
	- lat: Location based on latitude.
	- long: Location based on longitude.
	- sqft_living15: Living area in the property by year 2015.

Project

The following steps of the project will be organized in different folders for each task. You'll find in each of them a
readme explaining what was done and what are the results for each step.
