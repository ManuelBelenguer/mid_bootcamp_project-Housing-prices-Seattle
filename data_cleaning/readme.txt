Introduction

In the following notebook we'll perform all the data cleaning/wrangling necessary to have a dataset ready to perform
an explanatory data analysis (EDA) and to build our model. 

	Note: the dataset is already quite clean, so not many operations we'll be needed. 
    

Actions taken

As pointed above, the dataset was already pretty cleanned so apart from removing a row with a typo nothing else was done.
